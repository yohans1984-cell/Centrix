      <h3>About the Creator</h3>
      <p>
        Centrix was created by <strong>Myster H.G. (Mystro)</strong>, a designer and storyteller 
        who believes games should be simple to learn, yet powerful enough to challenge the mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idea for Centrix began as a hand-drawn sketch — a board with a central hub 
        and six outer points. That sketch evolved into a strategy game with balance, 
        timing, and psychological depth.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Centrix Was Created</h3>
      <p>
        Mystro wanted to build a game that feels ancient and modern at the same time. 
        A game where every move matters. A game that teaches patience, foresight, 
        and control.
      </p>

      <p>
        The wood-and-gold aesthetic reflects the classic, handcrafted feel of traditional 
        board games — but with a modern strategic edge.
      </p>

      <h3>What’s Coming Next</h3>
      <p>
        Da Mystro Gamings is developing digital versions of Centrix, more board and card games, 
        and interactive storytelling experiences that will continue to expand the universe 
        of creativity.
